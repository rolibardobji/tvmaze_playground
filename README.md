# tvmaze_playground

This is a playground application to interact with TVMaze API (https://www.tvmaze.com/api).

To run the project, run 'pod install' on the containing folder first. Then open the .xcworkspace file instead of the .xcodeproj file.

Pods installed:

Alamofire -> Library for simplifying interactions with remote APIs.
SDWebImage -> Library to load images from the web into UIImageView components.
RxSwift and RxCocoa -> Reactive programming implementations for Swift.
